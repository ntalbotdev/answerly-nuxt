# Answerly Nuxt App

A robust Nuxt 4 CRUD application leveraging Supabase for authentication, database management, and profile asset storage, Pinia for state handling, and Tailwind CSS for modern UI styling. Testing is provided via Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end automation.

## Features

- Supabase Auth (email/password)
- User profile creation and management
- Public profile pages
- Profile editing and assets upload (avatar/banner via Supabase Storage)
- Ask questions to any user (optionally anonymously)
- Users can answer questions they receive
- Questions are only published after being answered
- Follow/unfollow users (social feature)
- View followers and following lists for any user
- See mutual follow status on profiles
- Notifications for user activity and events
- Pinia for state management
- Middleware for route protection and redirects

## Storage & Profile Assets

- Each user can upload an avatar and a banner image to their own folder: `[user_id]/avatar.webp` and `[user_id]/banner.webp`
- The `avatar_url` and `banner_url` fields in the profile point to the public URLs of the uploaded images
- Make the bucket public for public URLs
- Use the RLS policies below to restrict access to profile assets

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

- Run unit tests using Vitest:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- Run end-to-end tests using Playwright:
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- Use Playwright codegen to generate tests:
  ```bash
  npm run codegen:e2e
  ```
  - This will open a browser window where you can interact with the app and generate tests automatically.
